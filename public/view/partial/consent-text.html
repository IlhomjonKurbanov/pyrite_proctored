<h4 class="text-center">RESEARCHER’S STATEMENT</h4>
<p>
    We are asking you to be in a research study.  The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not.  Please read the form carefully.  You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear.  When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not.  This process is called “informed consent.”  We will give you a copy of this form for your records.

<h4 class="text-center">PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h4>
<p>
    We are conducting an experiment to investigate the effect visual presentation has on readers’ perceived veracity, specifically in unfamiliar news sources. Our study will research different combinations of visual presentation elements in news articles such as font size, presence of images, and so on, to determine how the presence (or lack thereof) of these elements change readers’ opinions of the news article.
</p>
<br>
<h4 class="text-center">STUDY PROCEDURES</h4>
<p>
    In this study, you will be asked to view articles and rate them based on their believability. You will also be able to respond to certain elements that make the article seem more or less believable.
</p>
<br>
<h4 class="text-center">RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h4>
<p>
    Our study is not concerned with particularly controversial information. There are no foreseeable risks of harm greater than those experienced in daily life. The email addresses we collect from subjects for the drawing will be stored in a secure database, in no way linked to experiment response data.
</p>
<br>
<h4 class="text-center">CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION</h4>
<p>
    Our data will be anonymous, as no data collected from our study will be linked to any personally identifying information. Email addresses provided for the drawing will be kept in a separate database from gender, age, and experiment data, with no link between the datasets.
</p>
<br>
<h4 class="text-center">SUBJECT’S STATEMENT</h4>
